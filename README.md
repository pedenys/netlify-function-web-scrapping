# Netlify function web scrapping 

## Usage

```bash
# install dependancies
npm i
# run locally
npm run dev
# OR build function with its dependencies
npm run build
```

## Raison d'être

Simple web scrapping function example made with [netlify function](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) service (AWS Lambda under the hood) and [netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda) for building functions with their dependencies.

## TODO 

- [ ] reduce number of dependencies ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
